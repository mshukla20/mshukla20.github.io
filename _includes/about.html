  <p> I am a December 2020 Graduate student at Rutgers University pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology & Analytics.
   My Commendable Skills are in R, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Statistics and Data Analytics.  
   My passion for Data Analytics has given me a boost to complete two internships in a Data Science related field and passionately work on almost 6 projects where I used various Softwares and enhance my analytics skills.</P> 
   <p>I am looking for a  perfect Full time opportunity to use my technical knowledge in real world data which will directly affect the companies performance,
   which will be very motivating for me to work on and achieve my professional goals. </p>

      In a wide range of subject areas, I have analyzed structured and unstructured data to extract actionable business insights.
      I love to craft stunning and clever visualizations that illustrate surprising results.

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my software engineering skills, I've built and deployed AI services which create real business value.

      Whats the use of analyzing milions of rows of data if one can't visualize it. Tableau and Power BI are the best tools to tell a story from any given data.
      I'm also able to present complex results to a non-technical audience.
