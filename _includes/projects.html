    <h3> Project 5 |  Visual History of Nobel prize winners | Python </h3>
    <p>
      The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?
Well, let's find out! In this project, you get to explore patterns and trends in over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners. What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice? It's up to you to figure this out.
I have used the following:

<li>Data Manipulation with pandas</li>
<li>Intermediate Data Visualization with Seaborn</li>
<li>The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle</li>

    <h3> Project 6 | TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game | SQL  </h3>
    <p> Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird.
	The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:

<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>
<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>
<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>
<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>
